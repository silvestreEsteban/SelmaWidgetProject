<h1>This is my Mission Ready Level 6 Project - interning for Sebdata/SELMA</h1>
<h3>The project is to create a widget, using Symfony. The widget should be relevant to what SELMA does as a Student Management Service</h3>

<p>The first few weeks of the internship were dedicated to learning PHP and Symfony as they are a language & framework that I had minimal exposure to prior to the internship.</p>
<p>I did some youtube courses on PHP before starting the internship but the real work started once I began the task.</p>

<p>I created four widgets.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A widget to track how many people in a class/intake have some form of neurodiversity, and which neurodiversity they have.</li>
  <li>A widget to track the different learning styles that students in a class/intake have.</li>
  <li>A widget to track annual income and compare (for Selma admins)</li>
  <li>A widget to track how many drafts, invoices, and overdues are currently active (again, for Selma admins)</li>
</ul>
